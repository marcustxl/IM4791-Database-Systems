NTU Year 4 Project: Done by group of 5

# Tools Used
Microsoft Access

# Project Description
Propose a database case study or scenario. If your group has S students, your database should have at least (S + 3) tables. For example, a group with 2 students will need to have at least 5 tables in their database (including association tables). Write down the requirements on the database, i.e., database scenarios (see example scenarios in Tutorials. Avoid database jargons, such as entities and subtypes, in your scenario).
